It's recommended to use a virtual environment, for example: python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt a copy of file config.py should have been created in the root folder ( anon-pipeline-set ). Update the SALT variable in the file to desired value. (see features for details about salt). If the config.py file is not created automatically, it can be copied manually from templates/config_template.py . Run Quick Run with example data Try the following code for a quick run with an example dataset: ./anon_pipeline.py example_input/ -p my_results Here, my_results will be created containing the anonymised files. Run with your own data To anonymise you own data, you can create dataset in following structure <input_folder>/ <accession number 1>/ <DICOM file 1> <DICOM file 2> <accession number 2>/ <DICOM file 1> <DICOM file 2> and run the following code ./anon_pipeline.py <path/to/input_folder> -p <path/to/output_folder> Please note that the input and output folder don't have to be saved in the root folder. Continuous mode and restart mode In restart mode, the program assume there are no processed files (and folders) and would raise an error if it found any. This mode is the default. In continuous mode, if there are processed files in output folder, the program will skip them and continue to process the rest.
